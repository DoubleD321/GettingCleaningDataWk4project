## Project Wk4: The data for this assignment was collected from the 
## accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone of 30 volunteers. The 
## age bracket of the volunteers was 19-48 years. The data has been partitioned 
## into two sets: training and test. 
## The associated activities (6) each person performed are: 
## WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, 
## STANDING, LAYING. 

## A full description is available at the site where the data was obtained:
## http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones

## The R script, called wk4Project_updated.R, does the following:

## 1 Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
## 2 Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each 
## measurement. 
## 3 Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the
## data set 
## 4 Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
## 5 From the data set in step 4, a second, independent tidy data set 
## with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject was
## created. This file is called "tidy.txt"
